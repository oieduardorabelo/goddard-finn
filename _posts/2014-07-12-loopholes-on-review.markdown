So, let's talk about **REVIEW**, this messy hodge podge of ideas, by New Zealand director Jonny Hurts.

> `If one manages to travel faster than the speed of light...`

Actually, his name is very apt, since watching his film is mostly painful.
As most time travel films, logic is thrown out the window. Granted you must suspend your disbelief with this genre, but travelling by a wormhole, by means of a toilet, is ridiculous and crude.

## The idea was good, but...

If one manages to travel faster than the speed of light, then one is theoretically able to travel backwards through time. But wouldn't the time traveler need some form of protection from that speed? They are traveling in street clothes; nothing more. These time travelers would have major time chaffing...

> `They are traveling in street clothes; nothing more.`

Also, a major point. What was the point for his time travel? Self preservation? Revenge? Love?

## Nobody cares :)

But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness.

> `What was the point for his time travel?`

No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful.

Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure.

> `...but travelling by a wormhole, by means of a toilet, is ridiculous and crude.`

To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure? On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee
